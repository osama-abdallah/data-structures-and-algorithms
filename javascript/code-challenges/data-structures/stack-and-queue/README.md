# Stacks and Queues

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.


## Challenge
* Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

* Stack
Create a Stack class that has a top property.
- push
- pop
- peek
- is empty

* Queue

- enqueue
- dequeue
- peek
- is empty

## Approach & Efficiency

All methods on all classes are O(1) for time and space.
